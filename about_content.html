                    <p class="about-text">This is a fresh startâ€”new platform, new people, better community. Our community originally formed around the controversial live streamer Ice Poseidon, but evolved into a decentralized network of IRL streamers, pranksters, and content creators.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">We've rebranded to Internet-Platform 2 Infinity (IP2âˆž), marking our new direction. After being banned from multiple platforms (Reddit, Saidit), and with IP2Always.win now a shell of its former self, we're here to rebuild and recapture what made us great.</p>
