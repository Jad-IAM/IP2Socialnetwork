<h3>About Our Community</h3>

<p>This community originally formed around the controversial live streamer Ice Poseidon, but over time, it evolved into a decentralized network of IRL streamers, pranksters, and chaotic content creators. While we were once known for extreme trolling and toxicity, we're now shifting in a new directionâ€”keeping the humor and edge but with a more structured approach.</p>

<p>We have rebranded from IcePoseidon2 to Internet-Platform 2 Infinity (IP2âˆž), marking a fresh start. Over the years, we've been banned from multiple platforms (Reddit, Saidit), and while IP2Always.win is still technically online, it's a shell of what it used to be. That's why we're hereâ€”to rebuild, refine, and recapture the energy of the old days.</p>

<h3>Our Goals</h3>

<ul>
    <li>âœ… Bring back the witty, high-effort trolling that made this community legendary.</li>
    <li>âœ… Create a space for real discussions, not just mindless spam.</li>
    <li>âœ… Content is King. We will be making our own list of streamers and updating it through community pollsâ€”just like it once was, where everything goes through a vote.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<ol>
    <li>No Doxxing</li>
    <li>No brigading other communities</li>
    <li>No spamming</li>
</ol>

<h4>Few Notes:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Shitposting is fine, but make it worth reading</li>
    <li>ðŸ—£ Freedom of speech is respectedâ€”but don't be an uneducated, brain-dead fool.</li>
</ul>
